# How to Play  
  
## 1. Starting the Game  
    The game begins with two tiles appearing on the grid, each typically showing a 2 or sometimes a 4.  
  
## 2. Moving the Tiles  
    Use the Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move all the tiles on the board in a single direction.  
    Movement Rule: When you press a key, all tiles will slide as far as possible in that direction until they hit a wall or another tile.  
  
## 3. Merging Tiles  
    When two tiles with the same number collide during a move, they merge into a new tile with ## the sum of their values.  
        Example: Two 2 tiles merge to form a 4 tile. Two 1024 tiles merge to form a 2048 tile.  
    Merge Limit: Only one merge per tile per move is allowed. A single move can create multiple merges if different pairs of tiles collide and merge simultaneously.  
  
## 4. New Tile Appearance  
    After every successful move (a move that results in at least one tile moving or merging), a new tile (either a 2 or a 4) randomly appears in an empty spot on the grid.  
  
## 5. Winning the Game  
    You win the game when you successfully create a single tile with the number 2048.  
    Note: Many players continue playing after reaching 2048 to see how high they can score (e.g., 4096, 8192, etc.).  
  
## 6. Game Over  
    The game ends when the entire 4×4 grid is filled with tiles and you have no possible moves left (i.e., no adjacent tiles have the same value that could be merged).  
  
# ✨ The Game of 2048: A Simple Challenge, Endless Depth  
  
### 2048 is more than just a puzzle—it's an elegant, deceptively simple journey into numerical strategy. Set on a modest 4×4 grid, the game challenges your foresight and spatial thinking with nothing more than powers of two.  
  
## Experience the flow:  
    The Concept: Start with small, humble tiles (the 2's and 4's) and, with every calculated move, slide them across the board.  
    The Magic: Witness the satisfying moment when identical numbers collide and merge, their values combining into a larger, more powerful single tile (8,16,32,…).  
    The Goal: Strategically manage the cascading numbers, keeping the board organized as you chase the ultimate, elusive prize: the magnificent 2048 tile.  
  
### Easy to learn but impossibly difficult to master, 2048 is the perfect blend of luck and logic. Every successful merge is a triumph, and every move demands planning, making it a truly timeless and addictive numerical dance.
