# üí° How to Play

## 1. Starting the Game
The game begins with two tiles appearing on the grid, each typically showing a 2 or sometimes a 4.

## 2. Moving the Tiles
Use the Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move all the tiles on the board in a single direction.  
**Movement Rule:** When you press a key, all tiles will slide as far as possible in that direction until they hit a wall or another tile.

## 3. Merging Tiles
When two tiles with the same number collide during a move, they merge into a new tile with the sum of their values.  
*Example:* Two 2 tiles merge to form a 4 tile. Two 1024 tiles merge to form a 2048 tile.  
Only one merge per tile per move is allowed, but a single move can create multiple merges.

## 4. New Tile Appearance
After every successful move (a move that results in at least one tile moving or merging), a new tile (either a 2 or a 4) randomly appears in an empty spot on the grid.

## 5. Winning the Game
You win when you successfully create a single tile with the number **2048**.  
*(Many players continue to chase higher numbers ‚Äî 4096, 8192, and beyond!)*

## 6. Game Over
The game ends when the entire 4√ó4 grid is filled and no merges are possible.

# ‚ú® The Game of 2048: A Simple Challenge, Endless Depth

### üß© 2048 is more than just a puzzle ‚Äî it's an elegant, deceptively simple journey into numerical strategy.
Set on a modest 4√ó4 grid, the game challenges your foresight and spatial thinking with nothing more than powers of two.

**Experience the flow:**
- **The Concept:** Start with small, humble tiles (2's and 4's) and slide them across the board.  
- **The Magic:** Watch as identical numbers collide and merge into larger, more powerful tiles (8, 16, 32, ‚Ä¶).  
- **The Goal:** Strategically manage the numbers and chase the ultimate tile ‚Äî **2048**.

### üîç Easy to learn but difficult to master, 2048 blends luck and logic into a timeless numerical dance.
